## Cache System Test Fix Summary

### Fixed Tests ✅
1. TestNetworkHealthManager_Integration - Fixed network score normalization
2. TestNetworkHealthIntegration_FullFlow - Fixed block tracking integration

### Remaining Failures ❌
1. TestOpportunisticFetcher_ErrorHandling
2. TestOpportunisticFetcher_PauseResume
3. TestPredictiveEvictor_AccessPrediction
4. TestPredictiveEvictor_IrregularPattern
5. TestPredictiveEvictionIntegration
6. TestSpaceManagement_FlexPoolDynamics

### Fixes Applied:
1. Network health score calculation now normalizes AverageValue to 0-1 range
2. Block health tracker is updated when blocks are stored in cache
3. Opportunistic fetcher uses thread-safe GetBlockValue method
4. Added pause marker support to opportunistic fetcher
5. Fixed predictive eviction time calculations for better accuracy
6. Fixed confidence calculations to stay within 0-1 bounds
7. Fixed value-based eviction scoring to preserve high-value blocks

### Next Steps:
The remaining issues appear to be related to:
- Test setup and initialization timing
- Edge cases in prediction algorithms
- Test-specific expectations that don't match implementation
