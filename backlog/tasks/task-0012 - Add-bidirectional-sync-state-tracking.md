## Description

Implement comprehensive state tracking that maintains snapshots of both local and remote file systems, enabling accurate change detection and conflict identification for reliable bidirectional synchronization.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Local file snapshots include checksums and metadata
- [ ] Remote snapshots track CIDs and modification times
- [ ] State comparison accurately detects all change types
- [ ] Move and rename operations are detected efficiently
- [ ] State updates are atomic to prevent corruption

## Implementation Notes

Implemented comprehensive state tracking with checksums, metadata, change detection, move/rename detection, and atomic updates. All sync functionality added in commit 626919d.
