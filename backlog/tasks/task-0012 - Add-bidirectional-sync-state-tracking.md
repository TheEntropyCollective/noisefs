## Description

Implement comprehensive state tracking that maintains snapshots of both local and remote file systems, enabling accurate change detection and conflict identification for reliable bidirectional synchronization.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Local file snapshots include checksums and metadata
- [x] Remote snapshots track CIDs and modification times
- [x] State comparison accurately detects all change types
- [x] Move and rename operations are detected efficiently
- [x] State updates are atomic to prevent corruption

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented comprehensive bidirectional sync state tracking system with the following approach:

**Approach taken:**
- Created robust state management system for tracking both local and remote file system changes
- Implemented checksum-based change detection for accurate synchronization
- Added atomic state updates to prevent corruption during concurrent operations
- Built efficient move/rename detection algorithms to minimize unnecessary transfers

**Features implemented:**
- **Local File Snapshots**: Complete metadata tracking with checksums, timestamps, permissions, and file attributes
- **Remote Snapshots**: CID tracking, modification times, and distributed storage state management
- **State Comparison Engine**: Comprehensive change detection covering creates, updates, deletes, moves, and renames
- **Move/Rename Detection**: Efficient algorithms to detect file relocations without retransmission
- **Atomic State Updates**: Transaction-like state management preventing corruption during updates

**Technical decisions:**
- Chose checksum-based approach over timestamp-only for better reliability across systems
- Implemented atomic write patterns for state persistence to handle interruptions gracefully
- Used efficient diff algorithms to minimize computation overhead during state comparisons
- Added conflict resolution framework to handle simultaneous changes

**Key improvements achieved:**
- Reliable bidirectional sync with accurate change detection
- Efficient move/rename operations without full retransmission
- Atomic state management preventing corruption scenarios
- Comprehensive conflict detection and resolution capabilities

**Modified/Added files:**
- Enhanced sync engine with state tracking capabilities
- Added checksum calculation and metadata management
- Implemented atomic state update mechanisms
- Added move/rename detection algorithms

All functionality tested and verified in commit 626919d. The state tracking system provides reliable foundation for bidirectional synchronization with comprehensive change detection and atomic operations.
