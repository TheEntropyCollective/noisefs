## Description

Add logic to detect when local and remote changes conflict and implement resolution strategies to handle these conflicts according to user preferences while preserving data integrity.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Conflicts are detected when both sides modify same file
- [ ] Delete vs modify conflicts are handled correctly
- [ ] Resolution strategies (newest/local/remote) work as configured
- [ ] Conflict backups are created when needed
- [ ] User is notified of conflicts requiring manual resolution
