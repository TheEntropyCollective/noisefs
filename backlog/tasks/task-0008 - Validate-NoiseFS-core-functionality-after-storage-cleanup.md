## Description

Comprehensive end-to-end testing to ensure the 3-tuple XOR anonymization, randomizer block selection, and peer-aware operations continue working after storage package simplification.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] File upload with XOR anonymization works correctly
- [ ] Randomizer block selection and reuse functions
- [ ] Peer-aware backend operations maintain performance
- [ ] Download and reconstruction of anonymized files succeeds
- [ ] Privacy guarantees maintained after refactoring
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show no regression
- [ ] Integration tests pass
