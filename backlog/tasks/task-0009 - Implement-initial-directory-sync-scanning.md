## Description

Enable initial synchronization by scanning local and remote directories to identify differences. This establishes the baseline state for bidirectional sync operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Initial sync correctly identifies all local files and directories
- [ ] Remote directory manifest is retrieved and parsed
- [ ] Differences between local and remote are accurately detected
- [ ] Sync operations are generated for all differences
- [ ] Empty directories are handled correctly
