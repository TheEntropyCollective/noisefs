We're auditing the NoiseFS code in #ARGUMENTS. Do a /zen:review of the code.
Evaluate/look for:
- security issues
- unimplemented code
- build errors
- warnings/style issues
- redundant code
- unused code
- overcomplicated code
- privacy issues
- missing test coverage 
- broken/skipped tests

Create a plan to address the issues you find. Make the plan very detailed, breaking it down into small tasks. Deploy as many agents as you need to tackle each task. 
After cleanup, run tests and make sure they all pass.
