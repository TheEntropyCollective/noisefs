# NoiseFS Development Todo

## Current Status
✅ **Completed**: All major features implemented including FUSE filesystem integration
✅ **Completed**: Comprehensive testing (67 tests passing)
✅ **Completed**: Web UI with full functionality
✅ **Completed**: Core OFFSystem implementation with block anonymization

## Remaining Tasks

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for FUSE operations
- [ ] Optimize block reuse algorithms for better efficiency
- [ ] Add memory usage profiling and optimization

### Documentation
- [ ] Update README with latest features and usage examples
- [ ] Add developer documentation for contributors
- [ ] Create deployment guide for production use

### Production Readiness
- [ ] Add configuration file support
- [ ] Implement proper logging system
- [ ] Add health check endpoints
- [ ] Create Docker containerization

## Architecture Notes

### OFFSystem Implementation
- Block anonymization through XOR operations
- Multi-use blocks for storage efficiency
- Plausible deniability through randomized blocks
- Direct block retrieval without forwarding

### Current Performance
- Block reuse efficiency: 81-97% across scenarios
- Storage overhead: 2.00x (vs 900-2900% for traditional systems)
- Cache hit rates: 30-100% depending on workload

### Key Components
- **Block Manager**: 128 KiB blocks with XOR anonymization
- **IPFS Integration**: Distributed storage of anonymized blocks
- **Descriptor Service**: File reconstruction metadata
- **Cache Manager**: LRU cache with popularity tracking
- **FUSE Integration**: Transparent filesystem operations
- **Web UI**: Browser-based interface for file operations
