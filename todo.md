# NoiseFS Development Todo

## Current Status
✅ **Completed**: All major features implemented including FUSE filesystem integration
✅ **Completed**: Comprehensive testing (67 tests passing)
✅ **Completed**: Web UI with full functionality
✅ **Completed**: Core OFFSystem implementation with block anonymization

## Remaining Tasks

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for FUSE operations
- [ ] Optimize block reuse algorithms for better efficiency
- [ ] Add memory usage profiling and optimization

### Documentation
- [ ] Update README with latest features and usage examples
- [ ] Add developer documentation for contributors
- [ ] Create deployment guide for production use

### Production Readiness
- [ ] Add configuration file support
- [ ] Implement proper logging system
- [ ] Add health check endpoints
- [ ] Create Docker containerization

## Architecture Notes

### OFFSystem Implementation
- Block anonymization through XOR operations
- Multi-use blocks for storage efficiency
- Plausible deniability through randomized blocks
- Direct block retrieval without forwarding

### Current Performance
- Block reuse efficiency: 81-97% across scenarios
- Storage overhead: 2.00x (vs 900-2900% for traditional systems)
- Cache hit rates: 30-100% depending on workload

### Key Components
- **Block Manager**: 128 KiB blocks with XOR anonymization
- **IPFS Integration**: Distributed storage of anonymized blocks
- **Descriptor Service**: File reconstruction metadata
- **Cache Manager**: LRU cache with popularity tracking
- **FUSE Integration**: Transparent filesystem operations
- **Web UI**: Browser-based interface for file operations

## Review - 3-Tuple Migration (2025-07-07)

### Summary of Changes
Successfully completed the migration from 2-tuple to 3-tuple format following the OFFSystem standard:

1. **Fixed Build Errors**:
   - Updated `cmd/webui/main.go` to use `RandomizerCID1` and `RandomizerCID2` instead of the old `RandomizerCID` field
   - Updated `cmd/noisefs/main.go` to handle the new BlockPair structure
   - Updated `pkg/fuse/integration.go` for 3-tuple support

2. **Completed 3-Tuple Migration**:
   - Modified upload logic in all components to use `SelectTwoRandomizers()` method
   - Updated XOR operations to use `XOR3()` for 3-tuple anonymization
   - Changed descriptor creation to use `AddBlockTriple()` instead of `AddBlockPair()`
   - Updated download/retrieval logic to handle both 2-tuple (legacy) and 3-tuple formats
   - Adjusted storage overhead calculations from 2x to 3x

3. **Cleanup**:
   - Removed untracked `noisefs-mount` binary
   - Created `.gitignore` file to prevent future binary commits

4. **Testing**:
   - All tests pass successfully (67 tests across 7 packages)
   - All binaries build without errors

### Technical Details
The 3-tuple format improves security by using two randomizer blocks instead of one:
- Anonymized block = Data XOR Randomizer1 XOR Randomizer2
- Maintains backward compatibility with 2-tuple format through version checking
- Storage overhead increased from 2x to 3x but still far below traditional anonymous systems (9x-29x)
