# NoiseFS Testing & Robustness Implementation Plan

## Current Status
✅ **Completed**: Critical security fixes (SHA-256 block IDs, crypto integrity, secure randomization)  
✅ **Completed**: Full test coverage for blocks package  
✅ **Completed**: Web UI with RandomFS aesthetic
✅ **Completed**: Basic project structure and core functionality

## Phase 1: Cache Package Testing (High Priority)
- [x] Add comprehensive unit tests for cache interface
- [x] Test memory cache implementation (LRU eviction, popularity tracking)  
- [x] Test cache operations (store, get, remove, clear)
- [x] Test randomizer selection logic
- [x] Test popularity increment and GetRandomizers functionality

## Phase 2: Core Package Testing (High Priority)  
- [x] Add unit tests for descriptors package (serialization, IPFS storage)
- [ ] Add unit tests for IPFS client package (block storage/retrieval)
- [ ] Add unit tests for noisefs client package (high-level operations)
- [ ] Test error handling and edge cases for all packages

## Phase 3: Integration Testing (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Create end-to-end upload/download test
- [ ] Test multi-file scenarios with block reuse
- [ ] Test cache efficiency with repeated operations
- [ ] Test error recovery scenarios

## Phase 4: Robustness Improvements (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Add proper error handling for IPFS connection failures
- [ ] Add timeout handling for long operations
- [ ] Add graceful degradation when cache is full
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization

## Implementation Approach
- **Simple & Incremental**: One package at a time, following existing patterns
- **Test-Driven**: Write tests first to understand expected behavior
- **Minimal Changes**: Focus on testing existing code, not rewriting
- **Error Coverage**: Test both happy path and error conditions
