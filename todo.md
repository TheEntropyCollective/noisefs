# NoiseFS Implementation Plan

## Current Status
-  Basic project structure created
-  Block management (splitting, XOR, assembly)
-  IPFS integration for block storage
-  CLI with upload functionality

## Next Implementation Steps

### 1. Descriptor Management
- [x] Create descriptor data structure in `pkg/descriptors/descriptor.go`
- [x] Implement descriptor serialization/deserialization (JSON format)
- [x] Add descriptor storage to IPFS
- [x] Create descriptor retrieval functionality

### 2. File Download Implementation
- [x] Implement descriptor parsing in CLI
- [x] Add download command to CLI
- [x] Implement file reconstruction from descriptor
- [x] Test round-trip (upload then download)

### 3. Cache Management Foundation
- [x] Create cache interface in `pkg/cache/cache.go`
- [x] Implement basic in-memory cache
- [x] Add cache for popular randomizer blocks
- [x] Integrate cache into upload process

### 4. Improve Block Selection
- [x] Replace random randomizer selection with cache-based selection
- [x] Implement popularity tracking for blocks
- [x] Add block reuse metrics

### 5. Basic Testing
- [ ] Add unit tests for block operations
- [ ] Add integration test for upload/download
- [ ] Create test helper utilities

## Design Decisions
- Start with JSON descriptors for simplicity
- Use in-memory cache initially (can add persistence later)
- Focus on correctness over optimization initially
- Keep changes small and incremental

### Completed Implementation Summary

The NoiseFS distributed file system now has a fully functional core implementation:

**Core Features Implemented:**
1. **Block Management** - Files are split into 128KB blocks, XORed with randomizers for anonymization
2. **IPFS Integration** - Seamless storage and retrieval of anonymized blocks via IPFS
3. **Descriptor System** - JSON-based metadata for file reconstruction with IPFS storage
4. **Cache System** - LRU cache with popularity tracking for efficient block reuse
5. **Smart Block Selection** - Prioritizes popular cached blocks as randomizers over random generation
6. **Metrics Tracking** - Comprehensive statistics on block reuse, cache efficiency, and storage overhead
7. **CLI Interface** - Complete upload/download functionality with metrics display

**Key Achievements:**
- **Privacy**: All stored blocks appear as random data due to XOR anonymization
- **Efficiency**: Smart caching reduces redundant block generation and storage
- **Observability**: Real-time metrics show system performance and efficiency
- **Testability**: Round-trip test script validates upload/download functionality

**Architecture Highlights:**
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Cache-first approach for block selection optimizes storage efficiency
- Metrics provide visibility into OFFSystem performance characteristics
- All components follow Go best practices with proper error handling

**Next Steps:**
The foundation is solid for advanced features like unit testing, FUSE integration, and performance optimizations. The current implementation successfully demonstrates the OFFSystem principles while maintaining practical usability.
