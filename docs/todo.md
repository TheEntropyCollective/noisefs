- Web UI and CLI interfaces

### ✅ Milestone 2 - Performance & Production
- Configuration management system
- Structured logging with metrics
- Performance benchmarking suite
- Advanced caching optimizations
- Docker containerization and Kubernetes deployment
- Project organization and build system

### ✅ Milestone 3 - Security & Privacy Analysis
**Sprint 2: Security Hardening - COMPLETED (4/4 Tasks)**

Transformed NoiseFS from proof-of-concept into production-ready system suitable for sensitive content and streaming media.

**✅ Task 1: Network Security & TLS**
- Mandatory HTTPS/TLS for web UI with auto-generated certificates
- Strong TLS 1.2+ configuration with secure cipher suites
- Comprehensive security headers (CSP, HSTS, XSS protection)

**✅ Task 2: Descriptor Encryption System**
- AES-256-GCM encryption for file descriptors
- Argon2id key derivation from passwords
- User choice: encrypted (private) vs unencrypted (public) content
- WebUI integration with encryption toggle
- Backward compatibility with existing descriptors

**✅ Task 3: Streaming Media Support**
- HTTP Range request support for partial content (206 responses)
- Progressive download with on-demand block reconstruction
- Content type detection for proper media handling
- WebUI streaming mode with media preview functionality
- Privacy vs performance tradeoff with user choice

**✅ Task 4: Local Security Hardening**
- Encrypted local index storage with AES-256-GCM
- Secure memory handling with automatic cleanup
- Anti-forensics features for temporary file deletion
- Security manager coordinating all security features
- noisefs-security CLI tool for security management

**✅ Task 5: Input Validation & Security Headers**
- Comprehensive input validation framework
- Rate limiting with per-IP tracking and automatic bans
- Enhanced security headers with modern browser protections
- Request size limiting to prevent DoS attacks
- Protection against path traversal, XSS, and injection attacks
