# NoiseFS Development Todo

## Project Status: Production Ready ✅

NoiseFS has achieved **production-ready status** with the completion of Phase 4. All core functionality is implemented and tested, including performance optimizations, enterprise-grade deployment capabilities, and comprehensive developer tooling.

## Completed Major Phases

### ✅ **Phase 1-3: Core Implementation** (Historical)
- Core OFFSystem architecture with 3-tuple anonymization
- IPFS integration and distributed storage
- FUSE filesystem with complete POSIX operations
- Block splitting, assembly, and caching systems
- Web UI and CLI interfaces

### ✅ **Phase 4: Performance & Production** (Recently Completed)
- Configuration management system
- Structured logging with metrics
- Performance benchmarking suite
- Advanced caching optimizations (read-ahead, write-back, eviction policies)
- Docker containerization and Kubernetes deployment
- Project organization and build system

## Next Phase Roadmap

### **Phase 5: Security & Privacy Analysis** 
**Priority: High**

**Sub-Phase 5.1: Privacy Audit** ✅
- ✅ Formal privacy analysis of OFFSystem implementation
- ✅ Document anonymity guarantees and limitations
- ✅ Threat model documentation for different actors
- ✅ Plausible deniability verification
- ✅ Information leakage analysis

**Sub-Phase 5.2: Security Hardening**
- [ ] Security audit of all components
- [ ] Authentication and authorization systems

## Maintenance & Technical Debt

### **Ongoing Tasks**
- [ ] Dependency updates and security patches
- [ ] Code refactoring and optimization
- [ ] Test coverage improvements
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] Performance monitoring and tuning

### **Future Enhancements**
- [ ] Advanced anonymity features (onion routing for downloads)
- [ ] Cross-network federation (multiple IPFS networks)
- [ ] Content verification and integrity checking
- [ ] Decentralized reputation systems
- [ ] Smart contracts integration

## Technical Priorities

1. **Security First**: Privacy and security analysis before widespread adoption
2. **Scalability Research**: Understanding system behavior at large scale
3. **User Experience**: Making the system accessible to non-technical users
4. **Compliance**: Legal and regulatory considerations
5. **Ecosystem**: Building tools and integrations for broader adoption

## Development Process

- **Current Focus**: Moving to Phase 5 (Security & Privacy Analysis)
- **Release Cycle**: Major phases with sub-phase milestones
- **Quality Gates**: Security review, performance testing, documentation
- **Community**: Open source development with contributor guidelines
