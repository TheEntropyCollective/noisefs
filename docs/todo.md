# NoiseFS Development Todo

## Current Milestone: Milestone 3 - Security & Privacy Analysis

### ðŸŽ¯ Sprint 2: Security Hardening (3/4 Complete)

**Goal**: Transform NoiseFS from a proof-of-concept into a production-ready system suitable for sensitive content and streaming media.

#### âœ… Task 1: Network Security & TLS - COMPLETED
- âœ… Implement mandatory HTTPS/TLS for web UI
- âœ… Auto-generate self-signed certificates for development
- âœ… Support custom certificates for production
- âœ… Strong TLS 1.2+ configuration with secure cipher suites
- âœ… Comprehensive security headers (CSP, HSTS, XSS protection)

#### âœ… Task 2: Descriptor Encryption System - COMPLETED
- âœ… AES-256-GCM encryption for file descriptors
- âœ… Argon2id key derivation from passwords
- âœ… User choice: encrypted (private) vs unencrypted (public) content
- âœ… WebUI integration with encryption toggle and password fields
- âœ… Backward compatibility with existing descriptors

#### âœ… Task 3: Streaming Media Support - COMPLETED
- âœ… HTTP Range request support for partial content (206 responses)
- âœ… Progressive download with on-demand block reconstruction
- âœ… Content type detection for proper media handling
- âœ… WebUI streaming mode with media preview functionality
- âœ… Privacy vs performance tradeoff: user choice between modes

#### Task 4: Local Security Hardening
- [ ] Encrypt local index storage
  - [ ] Use OS keyring for key storage
  - [ ] Transparent encryption/decryption
  - [ ] Migration tool for existing indexes

  - [ ] Prevent swap file exposure
  - [ ] Use mlock for critical data
- [ ] Add anti-forensics features
  - [ ] Secure deletion of temporary files
  - [ ] Optional RAM-only mode
  - [ ] Cache encryption option

#### Task 5: Input Validation & Security Headers
- [ ] Comprehensive input validation
  - [ ] Sanitize all user inputs
  - [ ] Path traversal prevention
  - [ ] Command injection prevention
  - [ ] XSS protection
- [ ] Security headers implementation
  - [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - [ ] X-Frame-Options
  - [ ] X-Content-Type-Options
  - [ ] Referrer-Policy
- [ ] API security improvements
  - [ ] Request size limits
  - [ ] Rate limiting
  - [ ] CORS configuration
