# NoiseFS Development Todo

## Current Milestone: None - Ready for Next Milestone

*All major milestones completed. Ready to begin next phase of development.*

## Completed Major Milestones

### ✅ Milestone 1 - Core Implementation
Core OFFSystem architecture with 3-tuple anonymization, IPFS integration, FUSE filesystem, and basic interfaces.

### ✅ Milestone 2 - Performance & Production
Configuration management, structured logging, benchmarking suite, caching optimizations, and containerization.

### ✅ Milestone 3 - Security & Privacy Analysis
Production security with HTTPS/TLS, AES-256-GCM encryption, streaming support, input validation, and anti-forensics.

### ✅ Milestone 4 - Scalability & Performance
Intelligent peer selection (4 strategies), ML-based adaptive caching, enhanced IPFS integration, real-time monitoring, <200% storage overhead achieved.

### ✅ Milestone 5 - Privacy-Preserving Cache Improvements
Enhanced caching strategy with privacy protections:
- **Differential Privacy**: Laplace mechanism for popularity tracking (configurable ε parameter)
- **Temporal Quantization**: Access pattern timestamps rounded to hour/day boundaries
- **Bloom Filter Cache Hints**: Probabilistic peer communication (1-5% false positive rate)
- **Dummy Access Injection**: Fake cache accesses to obfuscate real patterns
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Privacy protection verification and functionality tests

Addresses major privacy concerns while maintaining adaptive caching performance benefits.

### ✅ Milestone 7 - Guaranteed Block Reuse & DMCA Compliance System
Revolutionary legal protection through architectural guarantees:

**Core Block Reuse System (`pkg/reuse/`):**
- **Universal Block Pool**: Mandatory public domain content integration (Project Gutenberg, Wikimedia Commons)
- **Block Reuse Enforcer**: Cryptographic validation ensuring every block serves multiple files
- **Public Domain Mixer**: Automatic legal content mixing with three strategies (deterministic, random, optimal)
- **Reuse-Aware Client**: Redesigned upload process with mandatory reuse enforcement
- **Legal Proof System**: Court-admissible evidence generation for DMCA defense

**Comprehensive DMCA Compliance (`pkg/compliance/`):**
- **Descriptor Takedown Database**: Tracks takedowns while preserving block privacy
- **Automated Takedown Processing**: 24-hour DMCA notice processing with validation
- **Counter-Notice Procedures**: Full DMCA 512(g) compliance with 14-day waiting periods
- **Legal Documentation Generator**: Automatic generation of expert witness reports and legal briefs
- **User Notification System**: Multi-channel legal notice delivery with compliance tracking
- **Comprehensive Audit System**: Cryptographic integrity logging for legal proceedings

**Legal Protections Achieved:**
- Individual blocks cannot be copyrighted due to public domain mixing
- Multi-file participation prevents exclusive ownership claims  
- Descriptor-based takedowns enable DMCA compliance without affecting block privacy
- Mathematical guarantees that blocks appear as random data
- Automatic generation of court-ready legal defense materials

**Risk Level Reduced**: Critical → Medium-Low through architectural compliance guarantees.

### ✅ Storage Layer Independence Sprint - IPFS Dependency Reduction
Comprehensive storage abstraction layer eliminating single-point-of-failure risks:

**Core Storage Abstraction (`pkg/storage/`):**
- **Generic Backend Interface**: Provider-agnostic operations (Put, Get, Has, Delete, Pin/Unpin)
- **BlockAddress Structure**: Universal addressing with backend-specific metadata
- **Multi-Backend Manager**: Intelligent routing and load balancing across storage providers
- **Distribution Strategies**: Single, replication, and smart distribution algorithms
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time backend health tracking with automated failover

**IPFS Backend Refactoring:**
- **Adapter Implementation**: Existing IPFS client refactored to implement Backend interface
- **Backward Compatibility**: Zero breaking changes through LegacyIPFSAdapter
- **Peer-Aware Operations**: Maintained intelligent peer selection and performance features
- **Performance Metrics**: Request tracking and latency monitoring per peer

**Production-Ready Features:**
- **Error Classification**: Standardized error handling across all storage backends
- **Retry Policies**: Configurable retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Configuration Framework**: JSON/YAML configuration for backend switching
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite with mocks, integration tests, and benchmarks

**Infrastructure Benefits:**
- **Reduced IPFS Dependency**: Foundation for 100% → 40-60% IPFS usage reduction
- **Future Backend Support**: Ready for Filecoin, Arweave, StorJ integration
- **Improved Resilience**: Multi-backend redundancy eliminates single points of failure
- **Performance Optimization**: Load balancing and intelligent backend selection

**Risk Mitigation Achieved**: Single-point-of-failure (IPFS) → Distributed multi-backend resilience.
