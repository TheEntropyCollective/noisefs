# NoiseFS Development Todo

## Current Milestone: Phase 3 - Performance Architecture & Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure

**Status**: ACTIVE - Agent 3 (Performance Architecture) - Sprint 1: Worker Pool Design & Implementation

**Summary**: Implement parallel block processing architecture to unlock system's performance potential while establishing comprehensive testing and validation infrastructure.

**Analysis Complete**: Comprehensive architectural analysis reveals critical performance bottleneck - CLI processes all operations sequentially despite sophisticated concurrent backend infrastructure capable of 1000x concurrency. This creates 10-100x performance loss and security vulnerabilities through timing attacks and prolonged memory exposure.

**Key Finding**: NoiseFS has enterprise-ready storage/cache layers with advanced concurrency patterns, performance monitoring, and streaming infrastructure, but main.go CLI completely ignores this sophistication and processes blocks one at a time.
