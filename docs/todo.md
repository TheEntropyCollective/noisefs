# NoiseFS Development Todo

## Current Milestone: Milestone 4 - Scalability & Performance

### Overview: Intelligent Peer Selection Algorithms

This milestone focuses on implementing sophisticated peer selection algorithms that optimize NoiseFS performance while maintaining privacy guarantees. The implementation will address four key areas:

1. **Randomizer-Aware Peer Selection**: Peers are selected based on their availability of popular randomizer blocks, maximizing block reuse and reducing storage overhead.

2. **Performance-Based Scoring**: Real-time tracking of peer latency, bandwidth, and reliability to optimize block retrieval speed.

3. **Privacy-Preserving Load Distribution**: Request routing and timing randomization to prevent traffic analysis while maintaining plausible deniability.

4. **Adaptive Caching Strategy**: Machine learning-based cache management that predicts block access patterns and coordinates caching across peers.

### Key Data Structures

```go
// PeerInfo tracks comprehensive peer metadata
type PeerInfo struct {
    ID              peer.ID
    LastSeen        time.Time
    Latency         time.Duration
    Bandwidth       float64 // MB/s
    SuccessRate     float64 // 0.0-1.0
    BlockInventory  *BloomFilter
    RandomizerScore float64
    Reputation      float64
}

// BlockAvailability tracks which peers have which blocks
type BlockAvailability struct {
    BlockCID    string
    Peers       []peer.ID
    Popularity  int64
    LastAccess  time.Time
}

// PeerSelectionStrategy defines selection algorithms
type PeerSelectionStrategy interface {
    SelectPeers(blockCID string, count int) []peer.ID
    UpdateMetrics(peer peer.ID, success bool, latency time.Duration)
}
```

### Integration Points

1. **IPFS Client** (`pkg/ipfs/client.go`): Add peer selection hooks to RetrieveBlock
2. **NoiseFS Client** (`pkg/noisefs/client.go`): Integrate peer metrics into randomizer selection
3. **Cache Manager** (`pkg/cache/cache.go`): Coordinate cache state across peers
4. **Descriptor Store** (`pkg/descriptors/store.go`): Distribute descriptors across selected peers

### Core Algorithms

#### 1. Randomizer-Aware Selection Algorithm
```
function selectPeersForRandomizer(blockSize, count):
    candidates = getAllHealthyPeers()
    for each peer in candidates:
        peer.score = calculateRandomizerScore(peer, blockSize)
    
    sortByScore(candidates)
    return topK(candidates, count)

function calculateRandomizerScore(peer, blockSize):
    inventoryMatch = peer.blockInventory.estimateMatches(blockSize)
    popularityScore = peer.getAverageBlockPopularity()
    diversityScore = peer.getBlockDiversity()
    
    return inventoryMatch * 0.5 + popularityScore * 0.3 + diversityScore * 0.2
```

#### 2. Performance-Based Selection Algorithm
```
function selectPeersByPerformance(requiredBandwidth, maxLatency):
    candidates = getAllPeers()
    filtered = []
    
    for each peer in candidates:
        if peer.bandwidth >= requiredBandwidth AND peer.latency <= maxLatency:
            peer.performanceScore = calculatePerformanceScore(peer)
            filtered.append(peer)
    
    return sortByPerformanceScore(filtered)

function calculatePerformanceScore(peer):
    latencyScore = 1.0 / (1.0 + peer.latency.Seconds())
    bandwidthScore = min(peer.bandwidth / 10.0, 1.0) // Normalize to 10MB/s
    reliabilityScore = peer.successRate
    
    return latencyScore * 0.4 + bandwidthScore * 0.3 + reliabilityScore * 0.3
```

#### 3. Privacy Mixer Algorithm
```
function routeRequestWithPrivacy(request, targetPeer):
    if shouldUseDirectRoute():
        return sendDirect(request, targetPeer)
    
    numHops = randomInt(1, 3)
    intermediatePeers = selectRandomPeers(numHops)
    
    // Add temporal delay
    delay = randomDuration(0, 500ms)
    sleep(delay)
    
    // Route through intermediates
    return routeThroughPeers(request, intermediatePeers, targetPeer)
```

#### 4. Adaptive Cache Prediction Algorithm
```
function predictBlockAccess(blockCID, accessHistory):
    features = extractFeatures(blockCID, accessHistory)
    
    // Simple ML model using exponential weighted moving average
    recentAccesses = getRecentAccesses(blockCID, 24h)
    trend = calculateAccessTrend(recentAccesses)
    
    predictedAccess = baselineAccess * trend * seasonalityFactor(time.Now())
    
    return predictedAccess

function shouldCache(block, predictedAccess, cacheSpace):
    benefit = predictedAccess * block.popularity * block.reuseCount
    cost = block.size / cacheSpace.available
    
    return benefit/cost > CACHE_THRESHOLD
```
