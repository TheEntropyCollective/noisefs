System requires immediate stabilization before production deployment due to interface compatibility crisis, cache system failures, and privacy guarantee regressions.

### Sprint 1 - Comprehensive Change Documentation ✅
**Objective**: Document all changes and issues from phases 1-4

**Completed Tasks**:
- [x] Analyze system state after phases 1-4 completion
- [x] Document Phase 1 achievements (compliance decomposition - 80% reduction achieved)
- [x] Document Phase 2 issues (cache optimization - major regressions despite 27% claims)
- [x] Document Phase 3 problems (storage abstraction - 70% complete but broken integration)
- [x] Document Phase 4 findings (integration validation - identified all critical issues)
- [x] Root cause analysis of interface compatibility crisis

- Impact: Type assertion failures in `pkg/core/client/client.go` lines 72-82
- Result: All integration tests failing with "IPFS client must implement PeerAwareIPFSClient interface"

**2. Privacy/Security Regressions (CRITICAL)**:
- TestBlockAnonymization failing: "Block 7 anonymized data failed randomness test"
