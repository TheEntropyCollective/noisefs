# NoiseFS Development Todo

## Current Milestone: Legacy Code Removal

**Status**: PLANNING COMPLETE

**Summary**: Systematic removal of 2-tuple legacy code to simplify codebase and improve maintainability. The system currently supports both 2-tuple (legacy) and 3-tuple (current) formats for backward compatibility, but all new files use 3-tuple format.

**Current Analysis**: 
- 2-tuple uses single randomizer (data XOR randomizer)
- 3-tuple uses two randomizers (data XOR randomizer1 XOR randomizer2)
- Descriptor version "2.0" indicates 3-tuple format
- Legacy versions indicate 2-tuple format
- System can read both formats but creates only 3-tuple
- ~500 lines of legacy code can be removed
