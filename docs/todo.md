# NoiseFS Development Todo

## Current Milestone: Milestone 3 - Security & Privacy Analysis

### ðŸŽ¯ Sprint 2 Overview: Security Hardening

**Goal**: Transform NoiseFS from a proof-of-concept into a production-ready system suitable for sensitive content and streaming media.

**Key Design Decisions**:

1. **Privacy-Preserving Streaming**: Implement streaming in a way that minimizes privacy leakage while maintaining usability for legal media content. Users can choose between "maximum privacy" mode (full download) and "streaming mode" (progressive download with some privacy tradeoffs).

2. **Flexible Security Model**: Support three deployment modes:
   - **Anonymous Mode**: No auth, public descriptors (current behavior)
   - **Private Mode**: Full authentication, encrypted descriptors
   - **Hybrid Mode**: Optional auth, user chooses encryption per file

3. **Performance Considerations**: 
   - TLS adds ~10-20ms latency but is mandatory for production
   - Descriptor encryption adds ~5ms but provides critical metadata privacy
   - Streaming mode reveals access patterns but enables media playback

4. **Breaking Changes Allowed**: Aggressive security improvements without backward compatibility constraints.

**Priority Order**: Tasks are ordered by security criticality:
1. âœ… Network Security (prevents eavesdropping)
2. âœ… Descriptor Encryption (protects metadata)
3. Authentication (controls access)
4. Streaming Support (enables media use case)
5. Local Security (prevents forensic analysis)
6. Input Validation (prevents attacks)

### Sprint 1: Privacy Audit âœ… COMPLETED & COMMITTED
- âœ… Formal privacy analysis of OFFSystem implementation
- âœ… Document anonymity guarantees and limitations  
- âœ… Threat model documentation for different actors
- âœ… Plausible deniability verification
- âœ… Information leakage analysis

### Sprint 2: Security Hardening (In Progress - 2/6 Complete)

#### âœ… Task 1: Network Security & TLS - COMPLETED
- âœ… Implement mandatory HTTPS/TLS for web UI
  - âœ… Auto-generate self-signed certificates for development
  - âœ… Support custom certificates for production
  - âœ… Strong TLS 1.2+ configuration with secure cipher suites
  - âœ… Comprehensive security headers (CSP, HSTS, XSS protection)
- âœ… Production-ready certificate management
**Result**: All web traffic now encrypted, ~10-20ms latency overhead acceptable for security.

#### âœ… Task 2: Descriptor Encryption System - COMPLETED
- âœ… AES-256-GCM encryption for file descriptors
  - âœ… Argon2id key derivation from passwords
  - âœ… User choice: encrypted (private) vs unencrypted (public) content
  - âœ… Secure memory handling with automatic cleanup
- âœ… WebUI integration with encryption toggle and password fields
- âœ… Backward compatibility with existing descriptors (version 3.0 format)
**Result**: File metadata now protected, ~5ms encryption overhead, flexible privacy model.

#### Task 3: Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Implement basic authentication system
  - [ ] JWT-based authentication for API
  - [ ] Session management for web UI
  - [ ] Secure password storage (bcrypt)
- [ ] Add user management
  - [ ] User registration/login endpoints
  - [ ] API key generation for programmatic access
  - [ ] Rate limiting per user/IP
- [ ] Implement file-level access control
  - [ ] Owner-based permissions
  - [ ] Shareable links with optional passwords
  - [ ] Time-limited access tokens
**Tradeoff**: Auth adds complexity and breaks anonymous usage. Recommendation: Support both authenticated and anonymous modes via configuration.

#### Task 4: Streaming Media Support ðŸŽ¬
- [ ] Implement progressive download
  - [ ] Range request support for video seeking
  - [ ] Chunked transfer encoding
  - [ ] Bandwidth throttling options
- [ ] Add HLS streaming support
  - [ ] On-the-fly playlist generation
  - [ ] Segment caching for performance
  - [ ] Adaptive bitrate support (future)
- [ ] Implement streaming optimizations
  - [ ] Prioritized block retrieval for streaming
  - [ ] Prefetch next segments
  - [ ] CDN-friendly caching headers
**Tradeoff**: Streaming reveals access patterns. Recommendation: Add "streaming mode" flag that trades some privacy for performance.

#### Task 5: Local Security Hardening
- [ ] Encrypt local index storage
  - [ ] Use OS keyring for key storage
  - [ ] Transparent encryption/decryption
  - [ ] Migration tool for existing indexes
- [ ] Implement secure memory handling
  - [ ] Clear sensitive data from memory
  - [ ] Prevent swap file exposure
  - [ ] Use mlock for critical data
- [ ] Add anti-forensics features
  - [ ] Secure deletion of temporary files
  - [ ] Optional RAM-only mode
  - [ ] Cache encryption option

#### Task 6: Input Validation & Security Headers
- [ ] Comprehensive input validation
  - [ ] Sanitize all user inputs
  - [ ] Path traversal prevention
  - [ ] Command injection prevention
  - [ ] XSS protection
- [ ] Security headers implementation
  - [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - [ ] X-Frame-Options
  - [ ] X-Content-Type-Options
  - [ ] Referrer-Policy
- [ ] API security improvements
  - [ ] Request size limits
  - [ ] Rate limiting
  - [ ] CORS configuration

### Sprint 3: Legal Protection Analysis
- [ ] Legal framework documentation for different jurisdictions
- [ ] User protection guidelines
- [ ] Compliance considerations
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies
