# NoiseFS Development Todo

## Current Milestone: Phase 3 - CLI Integration for Directory Support

**Status**: ACTIVE - Agent 3 (CLI Integration) - Planning Phase

**Summary**: Implement CLI integration for NoiseFS directory support, building on Agent 1's core infrastructure and Agent 2's storage integration. Add recursive directory upload/download, implement directory listing command, and enhance CLI UX with progress reporting and filtering.

**Analysis Complete**: Comprehensive CLI analysis reveals monolithic main.go structure with flag-based commands. Directory infrastructure exists (Agent 1's encrypted manifests) but Agent 2's processor/manager components are not yet implemented. Current upload/download functions only handle single files with sophisticated worker pool and streaming support.

**Key Finding**: CLI integration can be implemented by enhancing existing upload/download functions with directory detection, creating new `ls` command following existing subcommand patterns, and leveraging existing worker pool infrastructure for parallel processing.

**Integration Strategy**: Enhance existing functions rather than complete restructure, add directory detection logic, implement minimal directory processor if needed, and prepare hooks for Agent 2's directory components.
