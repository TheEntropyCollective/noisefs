# NoiseFS Development Todo

## Current Milestone: None - Ready for Next Milestone

*All major milestones completed. Ready to begin next phase of development.*

## Completed Major Milestones

### âœ… Milestone 1 - Core Implementation
Core OFFSystem architecture with 3-tuple anonymization, IPFS integration, FUSE filesystem, and basic interfaces.

### âœ… Milestone 2 - Performance & Production
Configuration management, structured logging, benchmarking suite, caching optimizations, and containerization.

### âœ… Milestone 3 - Security & Privacy Analysis
Production security with HTTPS/TLS, AES-256-GCM encryption, streaming support, input validation, and anti-forensics.

### âœ… Milestone 4 - Scalability & Performance
Intelligent peer selection (4 strategies), ML-based adaptive caching, enhanced IPFS integration, real-time monitoring, <200% storage overhead achieved.

### âœ… Milestone 5 - Privacy-Preserving Cache Improvements
Enhanced caching strategy with privacy protections:
- **Differential Privacy**: Laplace mechanism for popularity tracking (configurable Îµ parameter)
- **Temporal Quantization**: Access pattern timestamps rounded to hour/day boundaries
- **Bloom Filter Cache Hints**: Probabilistic peer communication (1-5% false positive rate)
- **Dummy Access Injection**: Fake cache accesses to obfuscate real patterns
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Privacy protection verification and functionality tests

Addresses major privacy concerns while maintaining adaptive caching performance benefits.

### âœ… Milestone 7 - Guaranteed Block Reuse & DMCA Compliance System
Revolutionary legal protection through architectural guarantees:

**Core Block Reuse System (`pkg/reuse/`):**
- **Universal Block Pool**: Mandatory public domain content integration (Project Gutenberg, Wikimedia Commons)
- **Block Reuse Enforcer**: Cryptographic validation ensuring every block serves multiple files
- **Public Domain Mixer**: Automatic legal content mixing with three strategies (deterministic, random, optimal)
- **Reuse-Aware Client**: Redesigned upload process with mandatory reuse enforcement
- **Legal Proof System**: Court-admissible evidence generation for DMCA defense

**Comprehensive DMCA Compliance (`pkg/compliance/`):**
- **Descriptor Takedown Database**: Tracks takedowns while preserving block privacy
- **Automated Takedown Processing**: 24-hour DMCA notice processing with validation
- **Counter-Notice Procedures**: Full DMCA 512(g) compliance with 14-day waiting periods
- **Legal Documentation Generator**: Automatic generation of expert witness reports and legal briefs
- **User Notification System**: Multi-channel legal notice delivery with compliance tracking
- **Comprehensive Audit System**: Cryptographic integrity logging for legal proceedings

**Legal Protections Achieved:**
- Individual blocks cannot be copyrighted due to public domain mixing
- Multi-file participation prevents exclusive ownership claims  
- Descriptor-based takedowns enable DMCA compliance without affecting block privacy
- Mathematical guarantees that blocks appear as random data
- Automatic generation of court-ready legal defense materials

**Risk Level Reduced**: Critical â†’ Medium-Low through architectural compliance guarantees.
