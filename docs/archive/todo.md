# NoiseFS Development Todo

## Current Milestone: ENCRYPTEDSTORE PRIVACY FEATURE ACTIVATION - PHASE 1 COMPLETE

**Status**: ✅ **PHASE 1 COMPLETE** - Testing Foundation Established

**Objective**: Activate dormant EncryptedStore functionality to address critical privacy gap where file content is encrypted but descriptors (metadata) are stored in plain text, revealing filenames, sizes, timestamps, and block structure.

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**:
- ✅ **Privacy Gap Identified**: NoiseFS encrypts content but stores metadata in plain text
- ✅ **EncryptedStore Analysis**: Well-designed but dormant - 0% test coverage, no CLI integration
- ✅ **Architecture Validation**: Sound implementation with proper security practices
- ✅ **Strategic Decision**: ACTIVATE dormant functionality, not removal
- ✅ **Implementation Quality**: Uses crypto.GenerateKey/DeriveKey, secure memory clearing

**PROJECTED IMPACT**: Users gain choice between public and encrypted metadata, closing privacy gap

**IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**: Five-Phase Activation Plan

```
PHASE 1: Testing & Validation (CRITICAL - Crypto Security)
PHASE 2: CLI Integration (HIGH - User Access) 
PHASE 3: Client API Integration (MEDIUM - Programmatic Access)
PHASE 4: Documentation & User Education (MEDIUM - Adoption)
PHASE 5: Advanced Features (LOW - Future Enhancement)
```
