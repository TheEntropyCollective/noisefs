# NoiseFS Development Todo

## Current Milestone: DESCRIPTORS PACKAGE TEST COVERAGE IMPROVEMENT

**Status**: 🎯 **IN PROGRESS** - Improving Test Coverage from 39.1% to 70%+

**Objective**: Improve test coverage for the pkg/core/descriptors package from 39.1% to 70%+ to match the quality of other core packages (blocks: 67.9%, crypto: 73.7%). Focus on critical functionality including encryption workflows, storage operations, and file reconstruction metadata.

**CURRENT ANALYSIS FINDINGS**:
- ✅ **Critical Coverage Gaps Identified**: encrypted_store.go (0% coverage), store.go (0% coverage)
- ✅ **Risk Assessment Complete**: Missing tests on encryption and storage operations increase risk of metadata corruption
- ✅ **Strategic Plan Developed**: 4-sprint incremental approach targeting high-impact areas first
- ✅ **Dependencies Mapped**: Mock storage.Manager and crypto test utilities required

**PROJECTED IMPACT**: 39.1% → 75%+ coverage (exceeding 70% target)
