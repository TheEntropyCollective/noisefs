# NoiseFS Privacy Infrastructure

## Overview

The Privacy Infrastructure in NoiseFS implements multiple layers of anonymity protection, from relay pools for distributed request routing to request mixing with cover traffic. This system ensures that users and network participants maintain plausible deniability while accessing and storing data.

## Core Privacy Architecture

The privacy infrastructure provides anonymity through several coordinated components:

1. **Relay Pool**: A distributed network of relay nodes that forward requests
2. **Request Mixer**: Batches and mixes real requests with cover traffic
3. **Cover Traffic Generator**: Creates realistic decoy requests
4. **Request Distributor**: Routes mixed requests through multiple relays
5. **Peer Selection**: Chooses optimal peers while preserving privacy

These components work together to obscure who is requesting what data and when, making traffic analysis extremely difficult.

## Relay Pool System

### How Relay Pools Work

The relay pool maintains a dynamic set of relay nodes that forward requests between clients and storage providers. Key features include:

**Relay Node Properties**
- Each relay has a unique peer ID and network addresses
- Capabilities define what operations the relay supports
- Health status tracks availability and performance
- Performance metrics guide intelligent relay selection

**Health Monitoring**
The system continuously monitors relay health by tracking:
- Availability status and uptime
- Response latency for requests
- Bandwidth capacity in MB/s
- Reliability score (0-1 based on success rate)
- Failure counts and recovery patterns

**Selection Strategies**
Three relay selection strategies balance different needs:
- **Round Robin**: Evenly distributes load across all healthy relays
- **Least Loaded**: Routes to relays with the lowest current traffic
- **Random**: Unpredictable selection to prevent traffic analysis

### Relay Pool Configuration

Pool behavior is controlled by several parameters:
- Maximum and minimum number of relays to maintain
- Health check frequency (default: every 30 seconds)
- Maximum relay age before rotation
- Required capabilities for relay nodes

## Request Mixing

### The Mixing Process

Request mixing is crucial for privacy. Here's how it works:

1. **Request Accumulation**
   - Real requests are collected into mixing pools
   - Pools wait for minimum size or timeout
   - Priority-based pools separate urgent from normal requests

2. **Cover Traffic Generation**
   - System generates fake requests that look real
   - Cover ratio determines decoys per real request
   - Popular blocks are used to make cover traffic realistic

3. **Temporal Obfuscation**
   - Random delays (jitter) are added to each request
   - Prevents timing correlation attacks
   - Configurable jitter range based on privacy level

4. **Distribution Across Relays**
   - Mixed batch is split across multiple relays
   - No single relay sees all requests
   - Load balancing considers relay capacity

### Mixing Configuration

Key parameters control mixing behavior:

**Mix Size Settings**
- Minimum mix size: 3-5 requests (privacy threshold)
- Maximum mix size: 20 requests (latency limit)
- Timeout: Maximum wait for batch accumulation

**Cover Traffic Ratio**
- Low privacy: 0.5 cover requests per real request
- Medium privacy: 1.0 (equal cover and real)
- High privacy: 2.0+ (more cover than real)

**Temporal Settings**
- Mixing delay: 100ms to 5 seconds
- Jitter range: Random delay per request
- Batch timeout: Maximum accumulation time

## Cover Traffic Generation

### Creating Realistic Decoys

Cover traffic must be indistinguishable from real requests:

**Block Selection for Cover Traffic**
- Popular blocks: Frequently accessed blocks that would normally be requested
- Random blocks: Adds unpredictability to patterns
- Historical patterns: Mimics real user behavior

**Cover Request Properties**
- Same size and format as real requests
- Realistic timing patterns
- Proper protocol compliance
- No distinguishing features

### Popularity Tracking

The system maintains popularity metrics to generate convincing cover traffic:
- Tracks which blocks are frequently accessed
- Updates popularity scores in real-time
- Uses historical access patterns
- Balances popular and random selections

## Request Distribution

### Multi-Path Routing

Requests are distributed across multiple paths:

1. **Relay Selection**
   - Choose diverse relays (geographic, network, operator)
   - Avoid using same relay repeatedly
   - Consider relay performance and capacity

2. **Request Splitting**
   - Batch is divided among selected relays
   - No relay gets enough to analyze patterns
   - Redundancy for reliability

3. **Connection Management**
   - Encrypted connections to all relays
   - Connection pooling for efficiency
   - Automatic failover on relay failure

### Distribution Strategies

Different strategies for different privacy needs:
- **Single Relay**: Fastest but least private (not recommended)
- **Fixed Distribution**: Consistent relay usage patterns
- **Random Distribution**: Unpredictable routing
- **Load-Based**: Considers relay capacity

## Peer Selection Strategies

### Privacy-Aware Peer Selection

When retrieving blocks, peer selection impacts privacy:

**Performance Strategy**
- Selects fastest peers for low latency
- Considers historical performance metrics
- Best for low privacy requirements

**Randomizer Strategy**
- Prefers peers with popular randomizer blocks
- Improves cache efficiency
- Balances privacy and performance

**Privacy Strategy**
- Maximum diversity in peer selection
- Avoids patterns and correlations
- Highest privacy but slower

**Hybrid Strategy**
- Intelligently balances all factors
- Adapts based on content sensitivity
- Default for most users

## Privacy Features in Detail

### Request Anonymization

Multiple techniques obscure request origins:

**Batch Processing**
- Never send individual requests
- Minimum batch sizes enforce mixing
- Prevents single-request analysis

**Traffic Mixing**
- Real and fake requests are indistinguishable
- Statistical properties match real traffic
- Automated mixing without user intervention

**Timing Obfuscation**
- Random delays prevent correlation
- Variable processing times
- Jitter applied at multiple stages

### Connection Privacy

All network connections maintain privacy:

**Encryption Everywhere**
- TLS for all relay connections
- No plaintext data transmission
- Forward secrecy for past communications

**Indirect Routing**
- Clients never connect directly to storage
- Multiple hops obscure true endpoints
- IP addresses hidden from storage nodes

**Dynamic Topology**
- Relay connections rotate regularly
- Prevents long-term traffic analysis
- Automatic failover maintains service

### Metadata Protection

System design minimizes metadata leakage:

**Request Uniformity**
- All requests padded to standard sizes
- No variable-length fields
- Protocol headers reveal minimal information

**Pattern Obfuscation**
- Cover traffic breaks access patterns
- Random timing prevents correlation
- Batch mixing hides relationships

## Performance Impact

### Privacy vs Performance Trade-offs

Higher privacy levels impact performance:

| Privacy Level | Latency Impact | Bandwidth Overhead | Description |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Low | +50-100ms | +50% | Basic mixing, minimal cover traffic |
| Medium | +200-500ms | +100% | Balanced mixing and cover traffic |
| High | +1-3s | +200%+ | Maximum mixing, extensive cover traffic |

### Optimization Strategies

Performance can be improved while maintaining privacy:
