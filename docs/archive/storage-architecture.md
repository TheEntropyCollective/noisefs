# NoiseFS Storage Architecture

## Overview

The Storage Architecture in NoiseFS provides a flexible, high-performance abstraction layer that seamlessly integrates with IPFS while maintaining the privacy guarantees of the OFFSystem. This architecture enables distributed, content-addressed storage with strong anonymity properties.

## Core Design Principles

### Abstraction Layer Philosophy

NoiseFS implements a storage abstraction layer that:

1. **Backend Agnostic**: Supports multiple storage backends (primarily IPFS)
2. **Privacy First**: All operations maintain anonymity guarantees
3. **Performance Optimized**: Intelligent routing and load balancing
4. **Fault Tolerant**: Retry mechanisms and error aggregation

## Architecture Components

### Storage Manager

The storage manager serves as the central coordinator for all storage operations. It manages:

- **Backend Registry**: Dynamically registers and tracks available storage backends
- **Request Routing**: Directs operations to appropriate backends based on strategy
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuously checks backend health and availability
- **Cache Integration**: Coordinates with the caching layer for performance
- **Metadata Management**: Maintains block metadata without compromising privacy

The manager supports multiple backends simultaneously, enabling hybrid storage strategies and seamless failover when backends become unavailable.

### Storage Router

The router implements intelligent backend selection through pluggable distribution strategies:

**Single Backend Strategy**
- Directs all operations to a primary backend
- Simplest approach for single-node deployments
- Minimal overhead and complexity

**Replication Strategy**
- Stores blocks across multiple backends
- Configurable replication factor (min/max replicas)
- Ensures data availability even if backends fail
- Tracks successful replications for consistency

**Smart Distribution Strategy**
- Automatically selects strategy based on available backends
- Falls back gracefully when backends are limited
- Balances performance, reliability, and cost

### Load Balancing

The load balancer optimizes backend selection using several algorithms:

**Round-Robin Distribution**
- Evenly distributes requests across backends
- Prevents hot spots and ensures fair utilization
- Tracks last-used timestamps for each backend

**Performance-Based Selection**
- Monitors success rates, latency, and throughput
- Calculates performance scores using weighted metrics
- Prefers high-performing backends while avoiding failures

**Least Connections**
- Routes to backends with fewest active operations
- Prevents overloading busy backends
- Ideal for varying request sizes

**Weighted Distribution**
- Assigns traffic proportionally based on backend capacity
- Considers factors like bandwidth, storage space, and reliability
- Adapts weights based on real-time performance

## IPFS Integration

### IPFS Client Architecture

The IPFS client extends standard IPFS operations with NoiseFS-specific optimizations:

**Peer-Aware Operations**
- Maintains peer performance metrics (latency, success rate, bandwidth)
- Prefers peers with good historical performance
- Falls back to DHT lookup when preferred peers fail
- Implements connection pooling for efficiency

**Parallel Retrieval**
- Attempts to fetch blocks from multiple peers simultaneously
- Returns first successful response
- Improves reliability and reduces latency
- Configurable concurrency limits

**Broadcast Support**
- Distributes important blocks to multiple peers
- Ensures redundancy for critical data
- Uses strategic peer selection for optimal coverage

### Content Addressing

NoiseFS leverages IPFS's content addressing with additional privacy considerations:

- **Deterministic CIDs**: Same content always produces same identifier
- **Integrity Verification**: Automatic validation of retrieved content
- **Network Deduplication**: Identical blocks share storage automatically
- **Privacy Preservation**: CIDs reveal nothing about original content due to XOR anonymization

### Peer Selection Strategies

When configured with a peer manager, the IPFS client employs sophisticated peer selection:

1. **Check Local Cache**: Avoid network requests when possible
2. **Try Preferred Peers**: Use peers with proven reliability
3. **Apply Selection Strategy**: Choose peers based on configured strategy
4. **Fall Back to DHT**: Use standard IPFS discovery as last resort

## Backend Interface Design

All storage backends conform to a unified interface that provides:

### Core Operations
- **Put**: Store a block and return its address
- **Get**: Retrieve a block by address
- **Has**: Check block existence without retrieval
- **Delete**: Remove a block (where supported)

### Batch Operations
- **PutMany**: Store multiple blocks efficiently
- **GetMany**: Retrieve multiple blocks in parallel
- Optimized for bulk operations
- Reduces round-trip overhead

### Management Operations
- **Pin/Unpin**: Control block persistence
- **HealthCheck**: Verify backend availability
- **GetInfo**: Retrieve backend capabilities and status

### Implementation Flexibility

The interface design allows backends to:
- Optimize operations for their specific architecture
- Report capabilities (e.g., persistence, searchability)
- Provide backend-specific metadata safely
- Implement caching at the backend level

## Performance Optimizations

### Parallel Processing

The storage system maximizes throughput through parallelization:

- **Concurrent Backend Operations**: Multiple backends process simultaneously
- **Batch Request Grouping**: Groups operations by backend for efficiency
- **Async Error Handling**: Continues processing despite individual failures
- **Resource Pooling**: Reuses connections and buffers

### Intelligent Retry Logic

Failed operations are handled gracefully:

1. **Primary Attempt**: Try specified backend first
2. **Fallback Selection**: Choose alternative backends by priority
3. **Error Aggregation**: Collect all failure reasons
4. **Smart Backoff**: Exponential delay between retries
5. **Circuit Breaking**: Temporarily disable failing backends

### Performance Monitoring

The system continuously tracks metrics to optimize performance:

- **Request Counts**: Operations per backend
- **Success Rates**: Percentage of successful operations
- **Latency Tracking**: Average and percentile response times
- **Throughput Measurement**: Bytes transferred per second
- **Resource Utilization**: Connection counts and memory usage

These metrics feed back into the selection algorithms, creating a self-optimizing system that adapts to changing conditions.

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation

The storage system maintains operation even when components fail:

- **Backend Failures**: Automatically routes to healthy backends
- **Partial Success**: Returns available data even if some operations fail
- **Timeout Management**: Prevents hanging on slow operations
- **Error Context**: Preserves error details for debugging

### Error Classification

Errors are categorized for appropriate handling:

- **Transient Errors**: Network timeouts, temporary unavailability
- **Permanent Errors**: Invalid addresses, corrupted data
- **Resource Errors**: Quota exceeded, insufficient space
- **Permission Errors**: Access denied, authentication failures

## Security and Privacy

### Content Protection

All storage operations maintain NoiseFS privacy guarantees:

- **Pre-Storage Anonymization**: Blocks are XOR'd before storage
- **No Metadata Leakage**: Block addresses reveal no content information
- **Access Pattern Obfuscation**: Random backend selection obscures patterns
- **Secure Transport**: All backend communications use encryption

### Trust Model

The storage architecture assumes:
- No single backend is trusted with content
- Backends may be curious but follow protocol
- Network observers cannot correlate operations
- Content addressing prevents tampering

## Configuration

Storage behavior is highly configurable to match deployment needs:

### Backend Configuration
- API endpoints and credentials
- Timeout and retry parameters
- Resource limits and quotas
- Feature flags and capabilities

### Distribution Strategy
- Default strategy selection
- Replication requirements
- Load balancing algorithm
- Failover behavior

### Performance Tuning
- Parallelism limits
- Cache sizes
- Batch operation thresholds
- Metric collection intervals

## Operational Considerations

### Monitoring

Key metrics to monitor in production:
- Backend health status
- Operation success rates
- Storage utilization
- Performance trends
- Error rates by type

### Capacity Planning

Consider these factors for deployment:
- Expected storage volume
- Read/write ratio
- Geographic distribution needs
- Redundancy requirements
- Growth projections

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements focus on:

- **IPFS Cluster Integration**: Native support for coordinated storage
- **Advanced Caching**: Predictive prefetching based on access patterns
- **Storage Proofs**: Cryptographic verification of data availability
- **Cross-Backend Migration**: Seamless data movement between backends
- **Enhanced Metrics**: Machine learning for anomaly detection

## Conclusion

The Storage Architecture provides a robust, flexible foundation for NoiseFS's distributed storage needs. By abstracting backend details while preserving privacy guarantees, it enables deployment across diverse environments from single nodes to global networks. The intelligent routing and monitoring capabilities ensure reliable operation while maintaining the strong anonymity properties essential to NoiseFS's mission.
