# NoiseFS Anonymity Guarantees and Limitations

## Executive Summary

This document provides formal anonymity guarantees for NoiseFS and clearly defines the limitations of the system. It serves as a definitive reference for users, developers, and security researchers to understand what privacy protections NoiseFS provides and what additional measures may be required.

**Key Guarantees:**
- ‚úÖ **Strong Content Anonymity**: Stored blocks provide computational anonymity
- ‚úÖ **Storage Provider Deniability**: Providers cannot determine stored content  
- ‚úÖ **Distributed Architecture**: No single point of control or failure
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limited Network Anonymity**: Dependent on external tools
- ‚ùå **No Traffic Analysis Protection**: Vulnerable to correlation attacks

## Formal Anonymity Properties

### Definition: Computational Anonymity
A system provides computational anonymity if an adversary with bounded computational resources cannot distinguish between different possible origins of data with probability significantly better than random guessing.

### Definition: Information-Theoretic Anonymity
A system provides information-theoretic anonymity if even an adversary with unlimited computational resources cannot distinguish between different possible origins of data.

### Definition: Plausible Deniability
A system provides plausible deniability if a user can credibly claim they did not store, access, or transmit specific content, even when evidence suggests otherwise.

## NoiseFS Anonymity Analysis

### 1. Block-Level Anonymity

#### Guarantee: Computational Content Anonymity ‚úÖ
**Formal Statement:** 
> Given a stored block B and no knowledge of the randomizer blocks R‚ÇÅ and R‚ÇÇ used in its creation, an adversary cannot determine the original content with probability better than 1/2^n where n is the block size in bits.

**Mathematical Basis:**
```
B = S ‚äï R‚ÇÅ ‚äï R‚ÇÇ
```
Where:
- S = Source block (original content)
- R‚ÇÅ, R‚ÇÇ = Cryptographically random randomizer blocks
- ‚äï = XOR operation

**Proof Sketch:**
1. XOR with truly random data produces computationally indistinguishable output
2. Without knowledge of R‚ÇÅ and R‚ÇÇ, any value of S is equally likely
3. Breaking this requires solving the randomizer blocks, which is computationally infeasible

**Limitations:**
- Assumes randomizer blocks are truly random (not pseudorandom with known seed)
- Assumes adversary cannot obtain randomizer blocks through other means
- Assumes XOR operation implementation is secure

#### Guarantee: Block Unlinkability ‚úÖ
**Formal Statement:**
> Given two blocks B‚ÇÅ and B‚ÇÇ stored in NoiseFS, an adversary cannot determine with probability better than random chance whether they originated from the same file.

**Basis:** Each block uses independent randomizer blocks, making correlation computationally infeasible.

**Limitations:**
- Timing correlation may provide linking information
- Side-channel attacks on block generation may reveal relationships
- Metadata from descriptors may enable linking

### 2. File-Level Anonymity

#### Guarantee: Descriptor Unlinkability ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Formal Statement:**
> NoiseFS provides limited unlinkability between file descriptors and the users who created them.

**Strength:** Moderate - dependent on IPFS anonymity properties

**Limitations:**
- IPFS DHT queries may reveal interest in specific descriptors
- Network timing analysis may correlate descriptor access with users
- No built-in protection against traffic analysis

#### Guarantee: Content Reconstruction Privacy ‚úÖ
**Formal Statement:**
> Without access to the complete descriptor and all required randomizer blocks, an adversary cannot reconstruct original file content.

**Strength:** Strong - requires exponential search space

**Basis:** Reconstruction requires:
1. File descriptor (specifies block arrangement and randomizer selection)
2. All randomizer blocks used in file creation
3. All anonymized data blocks

### 3. User-Level Anonymity

#### Guarantee: Storage Provider Deniability ‚úÖ
**Formal Statement:**
> Storage providers cannot prove they are storing specific content, providing plausible deniability against legal compulsion.

**Legal Basis:** 
- Stored blocks are computationally indistinguishable from random data
- No technical means to prove original content without randomizers
- Meets legal standards for deniability in most jurisdictions

**Limitations:**
- Does not protect against metadata analysis
- May not apply in jurisdictions with strict liability laws
- Could be circumvented by laws requiring disclosure of technical capabilities

#### Guarantee: User Activity Privacy ‚ùå
**Formal Statement:**
> NoiseFS provides no inherent protection against correlation of user activities through network analysis.

**Limitation Details:**
- IP addresses are exposed during IPFS operations
- Traffic patterns may reveal user behavior
- Timing analysis may correlate users with content
- Volume analysis may indicate activity levels
