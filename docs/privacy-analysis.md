# NoiseFS Privacy Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive privacy analysis of the NoiseFS distributed file system, which implements the OFFSystem architecture on top of IPFS. NoiseFS aims to provide anonymous, deniable file storage through block-level anonymization using XOR operations with randomizer blocks.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Strong content anonymity through 3-tuple XOR anonymization
- ✅ Plausible deniability for storage providers
- ⚠️ Metadata leakage through timing and access patterns
- ⚠️ Network-level privacy depends on IPFS anonymity properties
- ❌ No built-in protection against traffic analysis

## NoiseFS Privacy Architecture

### Core OFFSystem Properties

NoiseFS implements the **Owner-Free File System (OFFSystem)** with the following privacy principles:

1. **Block Anonymization**: Files are split into blocks that are XORed with randomizer blocks
2. **Multi-use Blocks**: Each stored block serves as part of multiple different files
3. **Content Deniability**: Original file content is never stored directly
4. **No Direct Mapping**: Blocks cannot be trivially mapped to specific files

### 3-Tuple Anonymization Process

```
Original File → Split into blocks → XOR with 2 randomizers → Store anonymized blocks

Block_i = Source_Block_i ⊕ Randomizer_1_i ⊕ Randomizer_2_i
```

**Privacy Properties:**
- **Confidentiality**: Stored blocks appear as random data
- **Unlinkability**: Individual blocks cannot be linked to original files
- **Deniability**: Storage providers cannot prove what content they store

## Privacy Analysis by Component

### 1. Block Storage Privacy

#### Strengths
- **Content Obfuscation**: All stored blocks appear as cryptographically random data
- **Multi-file Reuse**: Popular randomizer blocks are reused across multiple files
- **No Plaintext Storage**: Original file content is never stored directly
- **Computational Deniability**: Without randomizers, blocks cannot be meaningfully reconstructed

#### Weaknesses
- **Block Size Correlation**: Block sizes may leak information about original file types
- **Timing Correlation**: Upload timing may correlate with specific users
- **Descriptor Metadata**: File descriptors contain reconstruction metadata

#### Privacy Level: **High** ✅

### 2. Descriptor Privacy

#### Strengths
- **Distributed Storage**: Descriptors are stored across the IPFS network
- **Content Addressing**: Descriptor locations are based on cryptographic hashes
- **No Central Registry**: No single point storing all descriptor information

#### Weaknesses
- **Metadata Exposure**: Descriptors contain file size, block count, and reconstruction data
- **Access Pattern Leakage**: Descriptor access patterns may reveal file usage
- **Correlation Attacks**: Multiple descriptor accesses from same source

#### Privacy Level: **Medium** ⚠️

### 3. Network Privacy

#### IPFS Layer Anonymity
- **DHT Lookups**: Content discovery may reveal interest in specific blocks
- **Peer Connections**: Direct connections expose IP addresses
- **Request Routing**: No built-in onion routing or request anonymization

#### NoiseFS Network Behavior
- **Block Requests**: Pattern of block requests may reveal file reconstruction
- **Caching Behavior**: Cache hit/miss patterns may leak information
- **Timing Analysis**: Request timing may correlate with user behavior

#### Privacy Level: **Low** ❌

### 4. Client Privacy

#### Local Storage
- **Configuration Files**: May contain sensitive settings or preferences
- **Cache Contents**: Local cache may reveal recently accessed files
- **Index Files**: FUSE index maps file paths to descriptor CIDs

#### Memory Privacy
- **Process Memory**: Temporary storage of plaintext during operations
- **Swap Files**: Potential exposure through virtual memory swapping
- **Core Dumps**: Crash dumps may contain sensitive information

#### Privacy Level: **Medium** ⚠️

2. **Storage Deniability**: Storage providers cannot prove they store specific files
3. **Block Unlinkability**: Individual blocks cannot be linked to specific files without descriptors
4. **Distributed Risk**: No single point of failure or central authority

### Moderate Guarantees ⚠️

1. **Metadata Privacy**: File sizes and block counts may leak some information

The system is well-suited for scenarios where:
- ✅ Content anonymization is required
- ✅ Storage provider deniability is important  
- ✅ Distributed architecture is preferred
- ⚠️ Network anonymity is handled separately

**Overall Privacy Rating: B+ (Good)**
- Strong foundational privacy architecture
- Effective content anonymization
