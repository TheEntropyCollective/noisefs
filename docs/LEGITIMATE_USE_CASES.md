## Best Practices for Legitimate Use

### 1. Always Verify Rights
Before sharing any content, ensure you have the legal right to distribute it:
- You created it yourself
- It's in the public domain
- You have explicit permission from the copyright holder
- It's licensed for redistribution (GPL, Creative Commons, etc.)

### 2. Use Descriptive Topics
Help others find legitimate content by using clear topic hierarchies:
```
software/opensource/linux
content/books/public-domain/classic-literature
research/datasets/climate/temperature
education/courses/computer-science
```

### 3. Include License Information
Always include license information when sharing:
```bash
# Add license tags when announcing
./noisefs announce --tags "license:GPL-3.0,opensource"
```

### 4. Respect Privacy
