# Phase 2: Core Functionality Implementation Plan

**Status**: Ready for Execution  
**Builds On**: Phase 1 Security Fixes (Complete)  
**Objective**: Transform NoiseFS from security-hardened foundation to complete distributed storage platform

## Overview

Phase 2 addresses the high-priority incomplete implementations identified in the code review:
- Four CLI commands showing "implementation pending"
- Sync operations with placeholder implementations
- Missing directory sharing/receiving functionality
- Absence of error recovery and circuit breaker patterns
- Performance bottlenecks in state persistence

## Risk Management & Contingencies

### Critical Path Management

**Agent A Priority Support**:

- Other agents provide support if Agent A encounters blockers
- Daily check-ins to ensure sync integration stays on track

**Dependency Management**:
- Agent D work contingent on Agent A completion
- Network features (Agent B) can proceed independently
- Search implementation (Agent C) has no blocking dependencies

### Contingency Plans

**Timeline Flexibility**:
- Feature flags enable partial deployment if timeline slips
- Individual features can be released as they complete
- Rollback plan preserves Phase 1 security fixes

**Technical Alternatives**:
- Alternative implementations ready for complex integrations
- Simplified versions available for difficult features
- Graceful degradation for non-critical functionality

## Deployment Strategy

### Phased Deployment Approach

**Week 1: Infrastructure Deployment**
- Deploy infrastructure changes with feature flags disabled

- Performance monitoring and optimization

### Monitoring & Validation

**Continuous Monitoring**:
- Performance baseline monitoring throughout implementation
- Integration testing after each major commit
- Security validation to preserve Phase 1 protections
