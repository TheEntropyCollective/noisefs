# NoiseFS Streaming API Implementation - Sprint 2 Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented streaming client API for NoiseFS, enabling constant memory usage regardless of file size.

## Key Deliverables

### 1. StreamingSplitter (`pkg/core/blocks/splitter.go`)
- **StreamingSplitter struct**: Handles streaming file splitting with constant memory usage
- **NewStreamingSplitter()**: Creates streaming splitter with configurable block size
- **StreamBlocks()**: Processes blocks from io.Reader with callback-based processing
- **StreamingProgressCallback**: Progress reporting for bytes processed and blocks completed

```go
// Example usage:
splitter, err := blocks.NewStreamingSplitter(blockSize)
if err != nil {
    return err
}

blockProcessor := func(block *blocks.Block) error {
    // Process each block as it's read
    return processBlock(block)
}

progressCallback := func(bytesProcessed int64, blocksProcessed int) {
    fmt.Printf("Processed %d bytes, %d blocks\n", bytesProcessed, blocksProcessed)
}

err = splitter.StreamBlocks(reader, blockProcessor, progressCallback)
```

### 2. StreamingAssembler (`pkg/core/blocks/assembler.go`)
- **StreamingAssembler struct**: Handles real-time file reconstruction with XOR operations
- **NewStreamingAssembler()**: Creates assembler that writes directly to io.Writer
- **ProcessBlockWithXOR()**: Performs 3-tuple XOR and writes immediately to output
- **StreamingAssemblyProgressCallback**: Progress reporting for assembly operations

```go
// Example usage:
assembler, err := blocks.NewStreamingAssembler(writer)
if err != nil {
    return err
}

// Reconstruct and write block immediately
err = assembler.ProcessBlockWithXOR(dataBlock, randBlock1, randBlock2)
```

### 3. Streaming Client API (`pkg/core/client/client.go`)

#### StreamingUpload Methods:
- **StreamingUpload()**: Basic streaming upload
- **StreamingUploadWithProgress()**: Upload with progress callbacks
- **StreamingUploadWithBlockSize()**: Upload with custom block size
- **StreamingUploadWithBlockSizeAndProgress()**: Full-featured streaming upload

#### StreamingDownload Methods:
- **StreamingDownload()**: Basic streaming download
- **StreamingDownloadWithProgress()**: Download with progress callbacks

#### Progress Reporting:
- **StreamingProgressCallback**: Unified callback for upload/download progress
- Reports stage, bytes processed, and blocks completed

```go
// Example usage:
progressCallback := func(stage string, bytesProcessed int64, blocksProcessed int) {
    fmt.Printf("[%s] %d bytes, %d blocks\n", stage, bytesProcessed, blocksProcessed)
}

// Streaming upload
descriptorCID, err := client.StreamingUploadWithProgress(reader, "file.txt", progressCallback)

// Streaming download  
err = client.StreamingDownloadWithProgress(descriptorCID, writer, progressCallback)
```

### 4. Streaming-Aware Randomizer Selection

#### Optimized Methods:
- **selectRandomizersForStreaming()**: Non-blocking randomizer selection optimized for streaming
- **generateRandomizerPairFast()**: Fast randomizer generation for streaming workloads

#### Key Optimizations:
- Prioritizes cached randomizers to avoid blocking
- Falls back to fast generation when cache misses occur
- Maintains 3-tuple XOR anonymization requirements
- Integrates with existing cache and metrics systems

## Technical Achievements

### Memory Efficiency
- **Constant Memory Usage**: Memory usage remains constant regardless of file size
- **No Buffering**: Processes data as it flows through the system
- **Immediate Writing**: Assembler writes reconstructed data immediately to output

### Performance Optimizations
- **Streaming-Aware Randomizer Selection**: Avoids blocking operations during streaming
- **Cache Integration**: Leverages existing cache system for randomizer reuse
- **Progress Reporting**: Real-time feedback without performance impact

### Compatibility
- **Storage Manager Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing storage abstraction
- **Cache System Integration**: Leverages all existing cache strategies
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing Upload/Download methods remain unchanged
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling during streaming operations

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Scalability**: Can handle files of any size with constant memory usage
2. **User Experience**: Real-time progress reporting for large file operations
3. **Privacy Maintained**: Full 3-tuple XOR anonymization during streaming
4. **Infrastructure Ready**: Integrates with all existing NoiseFS components

## Success Criteria Met

✅ **StreamingUpload processes io.Reader with constant memory usage**
✅ **StreamingDownload writes to io.Writer with constant memory usage**  
✅ **Progress reporting works during streaming operations**
✅ **XOR anonymization maintained during streaming**
✅ **Seamless integration with existing NoiseFS infrastructure**

## Future Enhancements

The streaming infrastructure enables future optimizations:
- Concurrent randomizer generation during streaming
- Adaptive block size based on network conditions  
- Streaming-aware cache prefetching
- Bandwidth-adaptive progress reporting

## Milestone Status: COMPLETED ✅

Both Sprint 1 (Streaming Infrastructure) and Sprint 2 (Streaming Client API) have been successfully completed. NoiseFS now supports true streaming operations with constant memory usage, maintaining all privacy guarantees while providing excellent user experience through progress reporting.
